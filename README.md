<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

  - [Active Directory Home Lab](https://github.com/0xSp0rt/ActiveDirectoryLab/tree/main) <br />
This project features a fully built Active Directory lab deployed on Azure Virtual Machines to emulate a real-world enterprise network. It includes setting up a domain controller, configuring OUs, users, groups, and Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The lab is designed to demonstrate AD administration, security best practices, and scalable infrastructure in a cloud environment. <br /><br />
  - [Wireshark packet capture on iOS devices using Xcode](https://github.com/0xSp0rt/iOS-Packet-Capture) <br />
This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze network traffic from an iOS device using tools like Wireshark and macOS system utilities(Xcode). It covers the setup of a secure environment, traffic redirection via USB, and interpretation of packets for security analysis or troubleshooting purposes. <br /><br />
  - [Vulnerability assessment on Windows 10 host using Nessus](https://github.com/0xSp0rt/Vulnerability-assessment-on-windows-10-host-using-Nessus)<br />
This project showcases a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of a Windows 10 host using Nessus Essentials. It includes scanner setup, target host configuration, scan execution, and detailed analysis of discovered vulnerabilities along with remediation steps. The goal is to demonstrate practical vulnerability management techniques relevant to enterprise environments. <br /><br />
  - [Creating Group policy objects and enforcing App restrictions using AD](https://github.com/0xSp0rt/Creating-Group-Policy-Objects) <br />
This project demonstrates the creation and management of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) within a Windows Server Active Directory environment. It covers configuring policies to enforce security baselines, restrict user behavior, and automate system configurations across the domain. This hands-on implementation highlights the importance of centralized policy enforcement in enterprise networks. <br /><br />
  - [Creating Hyper-V Virtual machines using Powershell scripts](https://github.com/0xSp0rt/Hyper-v-creation-Powershell-script) <br />
This PowerShell script project aims to automate the creation and configuration of virtual machines (VMs) on Microsoft Hyper-V. Designed for efficiency and ease of use, it streamlines the process of setting up VMs with customizable parameters such as VM name, memory, CPU, virtual hard disk (VHD), and network settings. Ideal for system administrators and cybersecurity professionals, this tool simplifies lab environment setups, testing, and deployment tasks. The script ensures consistent VM configurations and reduces manual effort, making it a valuable asset for managing Hyper-V environments. <br /><br />
  - [Qualys Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation on Hyper-V virtual machines](https://github.com/0xSp0rt/Qualys-Vulnerability-Assessment/blob/main/README.md)<br />
This Qualys Vulnerability Assessment project is to automate and streamline vulnerability scanning and management. This tool leverages the Qualys API to perform comprehensive scans, identify security weaknesses, and generate actionable reports on Virtual machines created using Hyper-V. Designed for efficiency, it helps security teams prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities effectively, enhancing system security.
